I am currently a second year master's student advised by Prof. [Shengshan Hu](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/HUSHENGSHAN/zh_CN/index/2293173/list/index.htm) in School of Cyberspace Security at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://www.hust.edu.cn/)<img src='./images/xiaohui.png' style='width: 2em;'> and affiliated with [Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (T-AI)](http://trustai.cse.hust.edu.cn/) Group. I also advised by [Leo Yu Zhang](https://sites.google.com/site/leoyuzhang/home) from School of Information and Communication Technology, Griffith University. 
I’m an ambitious student passionate about well-rounded development. While focusing on Trustworthy AI studies, I also dabble in hardware – for example, I’ve independently built three complete robotic arm human-interaction systems from scratch (which were displayed at international tech exhibitions).
I aspire to become a knowledge-focused content creator in the future (though currently focusing on academic work) and welcome you to visit my Bilibili channel: [HUST-Rookie's Homepage](https://space.bilibili.com/your-profile-link). 

My research interest includes **Embodied AI**, **Adversarial Machine Learning**, **Backdoor** and **LLM Agent**.
